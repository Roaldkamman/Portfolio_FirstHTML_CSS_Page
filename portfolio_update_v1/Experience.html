        <h2 class="hcard">Sales</h2>
        <p>I have worked in sales for different companies and as a contractor. I have put personal time and effort into understanding the psychology and inner workings of sales.</p>
        <p>I believe that knowledge in sales and the psychology behind it can be leveraged in any business domain and I love finding new ways and places to apply my skills.</p>

          <h2 class="hcard">Marketing</h2>
          <p>During my sales journey, I also picked up critical marketing skills in email marketing, facebook advertisement and general marketing strategy. </p>
          <img src="images/mesit.jpg" alt="Roald sitting professional photo" class="profile-image">
          <p>I have learned how important it is to know what the market wants and how to find out exactly what it is the market wants and look forward to finding a way to merge this skill into my development projects.</p>

    <section class="card">
        <h2 class="hcard">Customer Service</h2>
        <p>My first job was in Security and I learned that Security is really just another way to say Customer Service. </p>
        <p>Just as with Security Customer Service's job is to represent the image of the company, prevent conflicts, be patient and treat people well. Making sure that everyone feels good.</p>
